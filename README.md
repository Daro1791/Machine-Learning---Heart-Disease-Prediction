# Machine-Learning---Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction system using Machine Learning with Python. 
We are going to use the data from Kaggle page (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

The correct prediction of heart disease can prevent life threats, and incorrect prediction can prove to be fatal at the same time. 
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Today, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide.

Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. 
The healthcare industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.

In this project, I will use Logistic Regression algorithm to determine if a person can have a heart disease. Others algorithms can be used for this like K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier
